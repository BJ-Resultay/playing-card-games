# VS Code Extensions

[> Back to TOC](table_of_contents.md)

This setup allows me to fix bad coding practices while writing code.

- autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator\
    This standardizes my documentation.

- markdownlint\
    This lints markdown files.

- Pylance\
    This tells me if the code does not work.

- Pylint\
    This standardizes my coding and points out my habits.

- Python\
    This lets me code in Python on VS Code.

- Python Indent\
    This automatically sets my cursor at the correct indentation.
    However, I am not keen on hanging indents very much.

- Todo Tree\
    This keeps tabs on various notes in the code.
