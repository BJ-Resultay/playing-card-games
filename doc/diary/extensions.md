Extensions add to my VS Code experience and provide useful capabilities.

## Workflow Extensions

These extensions enhance my workflow from coding to documentation.

- autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator\
    This is used to standardize method documentation with summaries, arguments, errors, and returns.
    Unlike type hints, doc strings are enforced by the linter.
    This extension just allows you to fill in the blanks in a template.

- Better Comments\
    TODO

- Bookmarks\
    TODO

- CodeTour\
    TODO

- GitLens â€” Git supercharge\
    This is used to enhance git commands.
    I mainly see who changed a specific line, at what time, and in what commit.

- Grammarly\
    This is used to lint my English.
    This extension gives me confidence that I am typing high-quality English.
    Sometimes, coding and grammar conflict, in which case I will favor coding.

- indent-rainbow
    TODO

- IntelliCode Completions
    TODO

- markdownlint\
    This is used to lint markdown files.
    This extension gives me confidence that I am typing high-quality markdowns.

    This is used to check Python code syntax.
    As a fellow human being, I make mistakes.
    This extension just makes it faster to catch and fix them.

    This is used to lint my code and search for duplicate code.
    This extension gives me confidence that I am typing high-quality code.
    PEP 8 describes best coding practices which I might not always prefer over an alternative.
    This extension allows me to go off the main road without getting lost.

- Python\
    This is more of a basic bundle for Python coding.
    This extension installs Pylance and allows for testing in the sidebar.

- Python Indent\
    This is used to automatically set my cursor at the correct indentation level.
    This extension shaves off time spent on deep indentation.

- Python TimeIt
    TODO
