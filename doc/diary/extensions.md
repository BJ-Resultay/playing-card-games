# Extensions

Extensions add to my VS Code experience and provide useful capabilities.

## Workflow Extensions

These extensions enhance my workflow from coding to documentation.

- autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator\
    This is used to standardize method documentation with summaries, arguments, errors, and returns.
    Unlike type hints, doc strings are enforced by the linter.
    This extension just allows you to fill in the blanks in a template.

- Bookmarks\
    This is used to mark lines and switch between them.
    This extension can be used simply from the sidebar.
    I am primarily marking files that do not change easily and that I have added to Files: Exclude.

- CodeTour\
    TODO: Create a tour after the first sample

- GitLens â€” Git supercharge\
    This is used to enhance git commands.
    I mainly see who changed a specific line, at what time, and in what commit.

- Grammarly\
    This is used to lint my English.
    This extension gives me confidence that I am typing high-quality English.
    Sometimes, coding and grammar conflict, in which case I will favor coding.
    I am disabling this extension until I want to lint,
    so I do not have to acknowledge 'misspellings' every time I reload the workspace.

- indent-rainbow\
    This is used to easily read indentations.
    If Python Indent automatically writes indents,
this extension aids in grouping code blocks.

- markdownlint\
    This is used to lint markdown files.
    This extension gives me confidence that I am typing high-quality markdowns.

- Pylance\
    This is used to check Python code syntax.
    As a fellow human being, I make mistakes.
    This extension just makes it faster to catch and fix them.

- Pylint\
    This is used to lint my code and search for duplicate code.
    This extension gives me confidence that I am typing high-quality code.
    PEP 8 describes best coding practices which I might not always prefer over an alternative.
    This extension allows me to go off the main road without getting lost.

- Python\
    This is more of a basic bundle for Python coding.
    This extension installs Pylance and allows for testing in the sidebar.

- Python Indent\
    This is used to automatically set my cursor at the correct indentation level.
    This extension shaves off time spent on deep indentation.

- Todo Tree\
    This is used to keep track of various TODOs and other tags in the sidebar.
    This extension tracks tasks that would otherwise be forgotten.

- YAML\
    TODO: Use to format player data

## Workspace Extensions

These extensions enhance my workspace and provide customization.

- Bad Apple!! player\
    This is used to play Bad Apple on command.
    Use monochrome font.
    Only pad checked in files, so changes can be discarded.

- Better Comments\
    This is used to color comments based on regex.
    As a visual person, colors help group code or in this case code documentation.

- Peacock\
    This extension is used to customize the border color.
    The best use is in conjunction with the Remote - SSH extension.
    If the same repository is located in different places,
    like a development server versus a production server,
    this extension can visually indicate the location.

- Remind Me\
    This extension is used to set custom vscode notifications.
    It is very difficult to continue working with notifications that fill the screen.

- vscode-icons\
    This is used to customize the folder and file icons.
    Folders are easier to navigate, especially from the root directory.

- vscode-pets\
    This is used to have a small interactable animal run around in a window.
    It is the equivalent of a hanging kitten poster.
