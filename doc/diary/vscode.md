# VS Code

[> Back to TOC](entries.md)

I used to exclusively use Terminal and Vim during college.
It worked great with single files.
As I worked with more files, I needed more windows.
Now, it's not simply file navigation, but all the other features that increase productivity.

- Moving files\
    Code will automatically be refactored to point to the new location.
- Colored code\
    Context sensitive code helps parse code faster.
- Extensions\
    Features can be added and customize VS Code.
- Files Exclude\
    I don't need to see every file in the project.
