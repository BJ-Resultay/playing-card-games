# Makefile

[> Back to TOC](entries.md)

Makefiles are the crutch to abstract complicated terminal commands into a simple target.
It's the first thing that was set up, including virtual environments.
I haven't used them since freshmen year because they were very intimidating.
There wasn't much difference between running `python3 file.py` vs `make run` to me.
This was until I was in a situation where the project I was in did not have a Makefile and did not use any languages I knew.
Not having a common language severely hampered my ability to write code.
When testing, I cannot even imagine a world where I have to type `./venv/bin/pytest tests` instead of `make test`.
