# Testing

[> Back to TOC](entries.md)

Automated testing is a staple of quality assurance.
Clean tests inspire confidence in my code.
Unit tests are fast.
Mocks are magic.
Pytest discovery in VS Code was a bitch.
FYI, `__init__.py` needs to be added to the entire branch so Pytest can find the source code.
Other tests are integration tests and end two end testing.
These ensure all the small parts fit together nicely.
