# Python

[> Back to TOC](table_of_contents.md)

After learning C/C++ in my freshmen year, I fell in love with Python so I didn't have to use closing braces.
I can relate to the PEP 20 - The Zen of Python.
I like writing beautiful code.
It's a major reason why I used a linter and an IDE when writing code.
It's also why I continuously refactor my code all the time.
If anyone is depending on my code, I apologize sincerely.
