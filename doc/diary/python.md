PEP 20 - The Zen of Python is my 10 commandments.
Beautiful code may not always be the fastest, but it is very optimized and elegantly expresses its function.
It is a major reason why I used a linter and an IDE when writing code.
It's also why I continuously refactor my code.
There are many ways to write the same code in Python.
It is looser than other languages in terms of syntax.
