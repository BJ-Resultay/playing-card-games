# Github

[> Back to TOC](table_of_contents.md)

Considering this repository is on Github, this should not need an introduction.
I've used Github in a couple of projects before for several college projects, but it was never the focus.
The only knobs I've turned are branch protection rules and workflows.
The former protects my code from someone trying to nuke it.
The latter automates testing and ensures my build is clean.
