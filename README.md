Python programming on various playing card games

Card games are fun and I love Python.
This project is to help me learn good coding practices.
It will (hopefully) include various games.

## Games

- [ ] blackjack

The Python version used is 3.11.2.
Python's minimum version is 3.10, which supports '|' type hints.
The shell used is bash.

## Things I learned

The reason I started this project is to learn good coding practices.
It would be simply useless to learn and forget them after finishing this project.
Therefore, I'm documenting them in the most likely place for me to find them again.
