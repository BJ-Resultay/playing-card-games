# Playing Card Games

Python programming on various playing card games

Card games are fun and I love python.
This project is to help me learn good coding practices.
It will (hopefully) include various games.

## Games

TODO:

- [ ] blackjack

## Notes

Python version used is 3.11.2.
Python minimum version is 3.7, which allows future annotations.
Shell used is bash.

## Things I learned

The reason I started this project is to learn good coding practices.
It would be simply useless to forget them after finishing this project.
Therefore, I'm documenting them in the most likely place for me to find them again.
This section contains no instructions.
Feel free to ignore this section.

### VS Code Extensions

This setup allows me to fix bad coding practices while writing code.

- autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator

    This standardizes my documentation.

- markdownlint

    This lints markdown files, obviously.

- Pylance

    This tells me if the code does not work.

- Pylint

    This standardizes my coding and points out my habits.

- Python

    This lets me code in Python on VS Code.

- Python Indent

    This automatically sets my cursor at the correct indentation.
    Though I am not keen on hanging indents very much.
