# Playing Card Games
Python programming on various playing card games

Card games are fun and I love python.
This project is to help me learn good coding practices.
It will (hopefully) include various games.

## Games
TODO:
- [ ] blackjack

## Notes

Python version used is 3.11.2.
Python minimum version is 3.7, which allows future annotations.
Shell used is bash.

Code coverage uses the VSCode setting
'Markiscodecoverage: Search Criteria'
equal to 'coverage.lcov'.
This is the default for pytest's
--cov-report=lcov option.
