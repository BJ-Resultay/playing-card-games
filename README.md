# Playing Card Games
Python programming on various playing card games

Card games are fun and I love python.
This project is to help me learn good coding practices.
It will (hopefully) include various games.

## Footnotes

Python version used is 3.11.2.
Shell used is bash.

Use `source .env` to set PYTHONPATH.
Code coverage uses the VSCode setting
'Markiscodecoverage: Search Criteria'
equal to 'coverage.lcov'.
This is the default for pytest's
--cov-report=lcov option.
Python3 version required to be 3.7+ to use pytest.
